**Period**: From the date of incorporation to March 31, 2026

### 1. Business Implementation Policy

In the initial business year, we aim to reliably implement the following projects under the sole management of the representative:

- Formulate and implement fundraising plans for operational stabilization and expansion.
- Develop AI curricula for children in accordance with the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's "Guidelines for Generative AI Utilization in Elementary and Secondary Education (Ver.2.0)".
- Launch a website to inform more citizens about our organization's activities.
- Gather basic preparatory information for introducing volunteers from the following year.
