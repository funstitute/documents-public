## Statement of Purpose for Establishment

### 1. Purpose

In recent years, AI and robotics technologies have rapidly permeated society, and their practical application has become an extremely important skill for children's futures. However, children in economically and domestically difficult situations have limited opportunities to experience these cutting-edge technologies and often cannot even find opportunities to learn. In particular, although AI utilization is a means to foster creativity and problem-solving abilities, many children are not even aware of its existence, creating a significant information gap as a major challenge.

This organization aims to provide free robotics and AI education using LEGO SPIKE and other tools to such children, fostering creativity, self-esteem, and digital literacy through practical learning. Our activities target an unspecified and large number of children, not limited to specific facilities or regions, promoting equal learning opportunities and contributing to improving the educational capacity of the entire local community.

We decided to establish this organization because we believe that obtaining legal entity status is essential for continuously and systematically operating activities and contributing widely to society by receiving grants and sponsorships from external sources.

### 2. Process Leading to Application

Since January 2025 (Reiwa 7), we have been preparing to implement volunteer robotics and AI classes in collaboration with "Nogiku-so," a mother-child support facility in Kyoto City. Currently, we plan to conduct a demonstration class for facility staff in May, and we expect to begin regular classes from around mid-2025.

In conjunction with this, we have been developing class materials and formulating business plans and budgets. We judged that incorporation is necessary to gain social credibility and have proceeded to apply for certification to establish a specified nonprofit organization.
